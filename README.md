Written in C# using .NET framework 4.8.<br />
This program acts as a system profiler similar to something like dxdiag or neofetch on linux. It displays the current users information in a fancy os9-like window. 
Mainly written as a test for handling WMI classes, which have to be parsed using SQL statements within C sharp, and I personally think are difficult to deal with. <br />
